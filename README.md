### All of my assignments and work for my Media Arts and Game Development class are found in this.
## Lab 3:
Topic: Bubbles
>In this lab, I created *bubbles* by allowing the person running the application to left click to place a circle and to right click in order to erase (pop) what was created, all while printing the coordinates when placed or popped. I also created a function to allow the user to hit the key **C** on the keyboard in order to print current coordinates without actually doing anything with bubbles.
## Lab 4:
Topic: Ocean
>In this lab, I created a *wave* in which is created by left clicking. In addition, I created a boat when the person running the application hits the key **B**. In addition, when the wave collides with the boat, the boat deletes itself, as it would appear to have been destroyed by the wave.
